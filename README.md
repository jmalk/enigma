# Enigma

An Enigma machine emulator written in TypeScript.

## TODO

I'll start by focussing on the Enigma I (1) to help answer these questions.

See https://www.cryptomuseum.com/crypto/enigma/i/index.htm

### Questions

- [ ] Does the Entry Wheel transform input?
- [ ] Can the reflector's position be set?
- [ ] Were there more than 26 characters on the keyboard? e.g. vowels with umlauts.
